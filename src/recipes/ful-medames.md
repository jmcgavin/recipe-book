## Instructions

1. Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil in a pan over low heat.
2. Add the red onion, garlic, serrano pepper (if using) and cumin seeds. Cook for 1-2 minutes to let the onions soften then add the tomato.
3. Once the tomatoes are soft, add the fava beans and water and simmer 5-10 minutes until it begins to thicken. At this point you can also slightly mash the fava beans for a smoother consistency.
4. When the fava beans have softened and your desired consistency is reached, turn off the heat and add tahini, lime juice and salt and pepper to taste.
5. Top with additional olive oil and serve with naan.
