## Ingredients

- 350g extra firm tofu, drained and cut into 1-inch cubes
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- ½ tsp black pepper
- ½ tsp garlic powder
- ¼ cup potato starch (cornstarch is fine)
- 3 tbsp neutral oil
- 2 scallions, chopped, for garnish
- 1 tsp sesame seeds, for garnish
- Rice (for serving)

Spicy honey garlic glaze

- 1 tbsp neutral oil
- 10 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp honey
- 1 tbsp gochujang
- 2 tbsp brown sugar
- 3 tbsp soy sauce
- ¼ cup hot water

## Instructions

1. Pat the tofu cubes dry with a paper towel to remove excess moisture. Add them to a bowl and season with salt, black pepper, and garlic powder. Sprinkle with potato starch and toss the tofu cubes until evenly coated.
2. In a wok or pan, add 2 tbsp of neutral oil over medium-high heat. Add the tofu in a single layer and fry for 2-3 minutes, flipping to crisp up the tofu on all sides. Repeat with the rest of the tofu and remove to a wire rack to drain.
3. In a pan, add 1 tbsp of neutral oil over medium-high heat. Sauté garlic for 30 seconds then add honey, gochujang, brown sugar, soy sauce and hot water. Mix to combine and heat until the mixture simmers and thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. Add the tofu cubes, mix and garnish with scallions and sesame seeds.
4. Serve with rice.

## Notes

- Dry tofu = crispy tofu. The key to crispy tofu is ensuring there is as little moisture as possible – I recommend patting it dry twice! When you remove the tofu out of the package and drain it, pat it dry with paper towels before cutting it into cubes. Once you’ve cut the tofu into 1 inch cubes, pat the cubes dry again with a paper towel before seasoning it.
- Tossing the tofu cubes in cornstarch will help them maintain their firmness and develop a crispy coating when fried, which also helps them hold up better in the sauce. Shake off any excess cornstarch to avoid a thick, pasty coating.
