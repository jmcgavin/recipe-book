## Ingredients

- 1 large yellow onion
- Tzatziki sauce (for serving)

Sauce

- 2 cups plain Greek yogurt
- ¼ cup lemon juice
- ½ cup olive oil
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp salt
- 1 tbsp ground coriander
- 1 tbsp paprika
- 1 tbsp ground cumin

Rice

- 2 tbsp unsalted butter
- ½ tsp ground turmeric
- ¼ tsp ground cumin
- 1½ cups basmati rice
- 2½ cups chicken broth
- Salt and pepper

## Instructions

1. Mix all sauce ingredients together.
2. Use half the sauce to marinade the chicken and reserve the other half serving later. Place the chicken and the reserved sauce in the fridge.
3. After 1.5 hours of marinating, remove the chicken from the fridge and begin preheating the oven to 400°F.
4. Cut a yellow onion in half and place the flat portion on a baking dish. Poke a skewer through the onion and stack the chicken thighs on skewer like a vertical rotisserie. Top with the remaining onion half and bake for 1 hour 45 minutes.

Rice

1. Melt the butter over medium heat in a large Dutch oven. Add the turmeric and cumin and cook until fragrant but not browned, about 1 minute.
2. Add the rice and stir to coat. Cook, stirring frequently, until the rice is lightly toasted, about 4 minutes.
3. Add the chicken broth. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
4. Raise the heat to high and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce to a simmer, and cook for 5. minutes without disturbing. Remove from heat and allow to rest until the water is completely absorbed and the rice is tender, about 10 minutes.

Serving

1. Slice chicken and onion halves. Serve over rice with dollop of your reserved sauce and some tzatziki sauce.
