## Ingredients

- 1kg chicken thighs (roughly 9 medium thighs)
- 2 packets taco seasoning
- 1 jar (480g) red enchilada sauce
- 1 can (540ml) black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 can (340g) fire roasted corn
- 2 cups uncooked jasmine rice

Low-calorie chipotle sauce

- 450g plain Greek yogurt
- 30g lime juice
- Chipotles in adobo (3 chipotle peppers + 25g adobo sauce)
- 30g honey
- 10g avocado oil
- 60ml milk (or as needed)
- Salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Add all ingredients to slow cooker. Cook on low for 4 hours.
2. When chicken is done cooking, turn off slow cooker and use tongs to shred chicken directly in the slow cooker pot. It's okay if it seems liquidy at this point. The rice will soak it up.
3. Cook the rice separately then add it to the slow cooker with the chicken and toss to combine.
4. For the chipotle sauce, blend all the ingredients together then drizzle over each serving.
