# Mayak Eggs (Korean Marinated Eggs)

## Info
* Time
  * 25 minutes

## Ingredients
* 6 large eggs (room temperature)
* 1 tbsp each salt and white vinegar (for boiling the eggs)
* green onions, seaweed flakes, and/or sesame oil (for garnish, optional)

Marinade
* ½ cup soy sauce
* ½ cup water
* ¼ cup honey, corn syrup, oligo syrup, or your choice of liquid sweetener
* ¼ medium onion diced
* 1 green onion diced
* 3 cloves garlic minced
* 2 chili pepper diced
* 1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds

## Steps
1. In a bowl or a container, add the marinade ingredients and mix to combine, ensuring all the honey is scraped from the bottom.
2. Add vinegar and salt to a pot of boiling water. Reduce the heat and gently place each egg into the water. Simmer for 6 minutes (or 10 minutes for hard-boiled eggs). Prepare a large bowl of ice water.
3. When the timer goes off, immediately transfer the eggs to the ice water bath. Allow the eggs to cool completely, for at least 5-10 minutes.
4. Gently peel the eggs and add them to the marinade. Cover tightly and store in the refrigerator overnight, or at least 6 hours.
5. To serve, place the egg over a bed of rice and garnish with green onion, seaweed flakes, and/or sesame oil to your preference. These eggs serve as an excellent garnish over a bowl of noodles as well. Enjoy!

## Notes
* These marinated eggs will last about 3-4 days in the fridge.
