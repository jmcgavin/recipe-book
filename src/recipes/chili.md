## Ingredients
* 450g ground beef

* 1 large onion diced
* 1 green bell pepper diced
* 1 large carrot chopped
* 1 clove garlic minced
* 1 packet chili seasoning mix (I use Old El Paso)
* 1 packet ranch dressing mix (I use Club House ranch style mix)
* 2 tbsp cocoa powder
* 2 tbsp olive oil (divided in 2)
* 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
* 2 tsp brown sugar
* ½ tsp chili powder
* ¼ cinnamon
* salt and pepper

## Steps
1. Remove sausage meat from casings and prep your vegetables.
2. Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil in a large dutch oven (or heavy-bottom stock pot)  over medium-high heat.
3. Add ground beef, sausage meat and garlic. Break apart the meat as it cooks.
4. Once meat is fully cooked, remove from pot and set aside.
5. Add the remaining 1 tbsp of olive oil to the pot.
6. Add the onion, bell pepper and carrot and sauté for a few minutes until vegetables begin to soften.
7. Add kidney beans and both cans of tomatoes and bring to a simmer.
8. Reduce heat to low and add the remaining ingredients.
9. Simmer for 4 hours with the lid ajar, stiring ocasionally.

## Notes
* If chili is still too liquidy after 4 hours of simmering, remove the lid fully and continue to simmer until chili reaches your desired consistency.
* For spicier chili, add 1 chopped jalapeno pepper with the other vegetables.
  * You can also add cayenne powder to taste.
