## Ingredients

- 450g ground beef
- 2 spicy Italian sausages, casing removed
- 1 can (796ml) diced tomatoes
- 1 can (540ml) seasoned, diced tomatoes (I use Aylmer Accents with chili seasonings)
- 1 can (540ml) kidney beans
- 1 large onion, diced
- 1 green bell pepper, diced
- 1 large carrot, chopped
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 packet chili seasoning mix
- 1 packet ranch dressing mix
- 2 tbsp cocoa powder
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp brown sugar
- 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- ½ tsp chili powder
- ¼ tsp cinnamon
- Salt and pepper

## Instructions

1. Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil in a large Dutch oven (or heavy-bottom stock pot) over medium-high heat. Add ground beef, sausage meat and garlic. Break apart the meat as it cooks.
2. Once meat is fully cooked, remove from pot and set aside. Add the remaining 1 tbsp of olive oil to the pot.
3. Add the onion, bell pepper and carrot and sauté for a few minutes until vegetables begin to soften.
4. Add kidney beans and both cans of tomatoes and bring to a simmer.
5. Reduce heat to low and add the remaining ingredients.
6. Simmer for 4 hours with the lid ajar, stirring occasionally.

## Notes

- If chili is still too liquidy after 4 hours of simmering, remove the lid fully and continue to simmer until chili reaches your desired consistency.
- For spicier chili, add 1 chopped jalapeno pepper with the other vegetables.
  - You can also add cayenne powder to taste.
