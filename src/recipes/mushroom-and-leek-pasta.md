## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 8 oz mushrooms, trimmed and sliced (cremini or bella work well)
- 1 clove garlic, finely chopped

- 8 lasagna sheets (or your pasta of choice)
- ½ cup heavy cream

- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Steps

1. Heat a large frying pan and add a dash of oil. Season the mushrooms with salt and pepper and start to saute them, adding the garlic after 2 minutes and the leek a minute later. Cook for 6-8 minutes until the leek is soft and the mushrooms are colored on the outside Taste and adjust the seasoning.
2. Add the stock and boil for 5 minutes until reduced by half.
3. Meanwhile, cook the lasagna sheets in a large saucepan of boiling salted water until just al dente.
4. While the lasagna is cooking, add the cream to the frying pan and simmer for 2-3 minutes to reduce a little.
