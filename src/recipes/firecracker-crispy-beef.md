## Ingredients

- 1 tsp neutral oil
- 1 onion, thinly sliced
- 450g ground beef
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp fresh ginger, finely grated
- 1 red chilli, deseeded and thinly sliced
- Sesame seeds, for garnish
- 4 green onions, for garnish
- Rice (for serving)
- Broccoli (for serving)

Firecracker sauce

- 4 tbsp sriracha sauce
- 2 tbsp honey
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tbsp rice wine vinegar

## Instructions

1. Mix together the firecracker sauce in a small bowl.
2. Heat the oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the onion and stirring regularly for 5 minutes until soft. Add the ground beef and cook for 5 minutes, until brown all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon or spatula.
3. Add the garlic, ginger, firecracker sauce, red chilli and stir to combine. Simmer the sauce until it has reduced completely into the beef. Cook for an extra 3-4 minutes on high heat, until the beef begins to turn crispy and caramelize. Don’t stir the beef too much at this point or the beef won’t have a chance to get crispy.
4. Once beef is crispy, remove from pan.
5. Serve the firecracker beef on white rice with broccoli and garnish with sesame seeds and green onion.
