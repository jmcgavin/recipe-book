## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 red onion, thinly sliced
- 1 red bell pepper, roughly chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 5-6 spicy Italian sausages, casing removed (any sausage will work)
- 1 cup long grain uncooked rice (I use basmati)
- 1 heaped tsp smoked paprika
- ½ cup dry white wine (for deglazing)
- 2 cups chicken stock
- 4 green onions, chopped
- 2 tomatoes, chopped
- Small bunch of flat leaf parsley, chopped 

## Steps

1. Add 1 tbsp of olive oil to a heavy-based casserole dish and sauté the onions on medium heat for 5 minutes until soft but not coloured.
2. Add the pepper and garlic and cook for 2 minutes while stirring so the garlic doesn't burn.
3. Push peppers and onions to the outside of the pan, turn the heat up to medium-high and add the sausage meat, breaking it up into bite-sized pieces.
4. Cook the sausages for 4-5 minutes until coloured.
5. Add the smoked paprika and mix. Add the rice and stir well to mix thoroughly and absorb the flavour.
6. Now deglaze the pan by pouring the white wine and scraping any bits stuck to the bottom.
7. Add the stock and bring to a boil, and then turn to a simmer, don't put a lid on.
8. Cook gently for 15-20 minutes until the rice is tender and the liquid almost entirely absorbed. Keep an eye on it and stir it from time to time. If the liquid is gets really low before the rice is fully cooked, put a lid on and turn off the heat. The rice will finish cooking within 5-10 min.
9. When the rice is soft, remove from heat and stir in green onions, chopped parsley and tomatoes and Enjoy!
