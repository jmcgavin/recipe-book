## Ingredients

- 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts, sliced into thin strips
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1½ tbsp taco seasoning (see my Taco Seasoning recipe)
- 2 tbsp olive oil, divided in 2
- 2 bell peppers, thinly sliced
- 1 onion, thinly sliced
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Juice of ½ lime
- 2 tbsp chopped cilantro or parsley
- Flour tortillas (for serving)
- Plain Greek yogurt or sour cream (for serving)

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, combine chicken, cilantro, garlic and 1½ tbsp of taco seasoning. Toss until chicken is coated and set aside.
2. Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
3. Add the peppers in a single layer. Try to get them a little charred underneath before you move them around. Once they've begun to brown, add sliced onion and season to taste with salt and pepper. Wait again for some colour to develop before you move them.
4. When peppers are nicely charred in spots and onions have softened, scrape mixture onto a plate to clear the skillet.
5. Return the skillet to the burner and heat remaining 1 tbsp of olive oil. When sizzling, spread chicken strips in a single layer. Wait until they brown underneath to move them. Sauté the chicken, regularly pausing so they can get some colour, until cooked through (about 6 minutes).
6. Return the pepper mixture to the skillet, add the lime juice and heat again until everything is sizzling.
7. Sprinkle with chopped fresh cilantro and serve.

Assembly

1. Add a spoonful of plain Greek yogurt (or sour cream) to a warm tortilla.
2. Add some of your chicken mixture.
3. Roll it up and enjoy.
