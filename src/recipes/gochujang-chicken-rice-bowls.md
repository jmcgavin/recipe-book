## Ingredients

- 450g ground chicken (or turkey)
- 2 green onions
- ¼ yellow onion
- 5 cloves garlic
- 1 small knob of ginger
- 1-2 mild chili peppers (or bell pepper), for color
- 2 tbsp neutral oil, plus more if needed
- Kosher salt, to taste
- 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
- Soft-boiled eggs (optional), to serve
- Generous pinch of toasted sesame seeds
- Rice (for serving)

Sauce
- 2 tbsp Korean chili pepper flakes (gochugaru)
- 2 tbsp Korean chili paste (gochujang)
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp oyster sauce
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1 tbsp mirin

## Steps

1. Thinly slice the green onions, separating the whites and greens. Finely dice the onion. Smash the garlic cloves and finely chop them. Grate a small knob of ginger (1 tsp). Thinly slice the chili peppers.
2. Make the sauce. In a small container, mix together the Korean chili pepper flakes, Korean chili paste, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, and mirin.
3. In a wok (or pan), heat the oil (2 tbsp) over high heat. Once it gets nice and hot, add the minced chicken. Spread it out and leave it in the pan for 2 minutes or the chicken is nicely browned on the bottom. Flip and stir-fry it for 4 minutes. 
4. Once the chicken is cooked and most of the liquid has evaporated, add the white part of the green onions, onion, garlic and ginger. Saute for 2 minutes. Add more oil if needed.
5. Once the garlic turns golden brown, add in the sauce. Give it a good stir for 2 more minutes. Taste and add more salt to taste. 
6. Add the remaining green onions, chili peppers, black pepper to taste, and sesame oil. Give it a final mix.
7. Divide the rice into serving bowls. Add a generous amount of chicken stir-fry, and soft-boiled eggs (if using). Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Enjoy!
