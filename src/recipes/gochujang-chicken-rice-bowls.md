## Instructions

1. In a small bowl, mix together the sauce ingredients and set aside.
2. In a wok (or pan), heat 2 tbsp of neutral oil over medium-high heat. Add the ground chicken. Spread it out and leave it in the pan for a few minutes until the chicken is nicely browned on the bottom. Flip and stir-fry until fully cooked and most of the liquid has evaporated.
