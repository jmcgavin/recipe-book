## Ingredients

- 200g ground pork (or chicken, beef, tofu, etc.)
- 200g Taiwanese knife-sliced noodles (or udon, spaghetti, rice noodles, etc.)
- 2 green onions
- 2 baby bok choy
- 3 tbsp neutral oil
- 10-15 garlic cloves
- 1 tsp ginger, grated
- Black pepper, to taste
- Generous pinch of toasted sesame seeds, to garnish

Sauce
- 2-3 tbsp Korean chili pepper flakes (gochugaru)
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tbsp oyster sauce
- 1 tbsp Shaoxing wine (or mirin, dry sherry, water, etc.)

## Instructions

1. Thinly slice the green onions, separating the whites and the greens. Finely chop the garlic cloves.
2. Grate a small knob of ginger if you are using pork. Trim off the ends of the bok choy. Cut in half (or quarters) lengthwise.
3. In a small container, mix together the Korean chili pepper flakes, sugar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and Shaoxing wine (if using).
4. Prepare the bok choy and noodles: Bring a pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, blanch the bok choy for 1 minute, until slightly softened. Remove from the pot and set aside.
5. In the same water, cook the noodles according to the package instructions.
6. Meanwhile, to a wok (or pan), add 3 tablespoons of oil. Heat it over medium-high heat. Once it’s heated, add the white parts of the green onions, garlic, and ginger. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes or until they get a little bit of color.
7. Add the ground pork and black pepper to taste. Break up the pork and sauté for 1 to 2 minutes or until no longer pink. Reduce the heat to medium (or low). Add in the sauce and keep stirring it for 1 to 2 minutes.
8. Add the drained noodles. Toss together until nicely coated. Divide the noodles onto serving plates. Garnish with the bok choy, green onions, and sesame seeds. Enjoy!
