## Ingredients

- 4 baby bok choy
- 400g Taiwanese knife-sliced noodles (or udon, spaghetti, rice noodles, etc.)
- 2 tbsp neutral oil
- 6 green onions (whites only, reserve greens for garnish)
- 10-15 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 tbsp ginger, finely grated
- 450g ground pork (or chicken, beef, tofu, etc.)
- Black pepper, to taste
- Generous pinch of toasted sesame seeds, to garnish

Sauce
- 2-3 tbsp gochugaru (Korean chili pepper flakes)
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tbsp oyster sauce
- 1 tbsp Shaoxing wine (or mirin, dry sherry, water, etc.)

## Instructions

1. Grate a small knob of ginger if you are using pork. Trim off the ends of the bok choy. Cut in half (or quarters) lengthwise.
2. In a small bowl, mix together the sauce ingredients.
3. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, blanch the bok choy for 1 minute, until slightly softened. Remove from the pot and set aside.
4. In the same water, cook the noodles according to the package instructions.
5. Meanwhile, to a wok (or pan), add 2 tbsp of oil and heat over medium-high heat.
6. Add the white parts of the green onions, garlic, and ginger. Cook for 1-2 minutes until they get a little bit of color.
7. Add the ground pork and black pepper to taste. Break up the pork and sauté for 2-3 minutes, until no longer pink.
8. Reduce the heat to medium and add in the sauce. Continue to cook until pork is fully cooked, stirring occasionally.
9. Turn off the heat and add the drained noodles. Toss together until coated. Divide the noodles onto serving plates. Garnish with the bok choy, green onions, and sesame seeds. Enjoy!
