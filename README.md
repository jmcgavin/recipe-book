## 👨🏻‍🍳 Background

I've spent years gathering and collecting recipes from a variety of physical and digital sources. Over time it grew into a disorganized mess of bookmarks, YouTube videos, Instagram posts, TikToks, screenshots, magazine clippings, recipe books, etc. I told myself there had to be a better way to save, organize and categorize all the recipes I amass. But when I couldn't find one, I decided to make it myself!

## Features

- 📖 Browse recipes
- 🔍 View detailed recipe information including ingredients, steps, and notes
- 📝 Markdown-based recipe format for easy editing and version control
- 🎨 Responsive design with component-based architecture

## Tech Stack

- **React** - UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Vite** - Build tool and development server
- **React Router** - Routing
- **Marked** - Markdown parsing
- **CSS Modules** - Scoped styling

## TODO

- Search recipes by name
- Filter recipes by tags

Happy cooking! 🍳
